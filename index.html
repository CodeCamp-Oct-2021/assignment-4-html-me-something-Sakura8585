      <h1>My Favorite Japanese Stationary</h1>
         <h2>Frixion Pens</h2>
         <p>Frixion pens are one of my favorites because they come in such beatiful colors while also being erasable like a pencil.
            I really enjoy taking notes with these pens because I can color and style them without having to worry about making mistakes.</p>
            
      <h3>Kokuyo Campus Smartring Binder</h3>
         <p>This binder is a favorite of mine because it has the thinness and portability of a notebook.
         Another great part of it is that it comes with different types of loose leaf paper for different types of note taking.</p>
