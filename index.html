   <h3>Frixion Pens</h3>
         <p>Frixion pens are one of my favorites because they come in such beatiful colors while also being erasable like a pencil.
            I really enjoy taking notes with these pens because I can color and style them without having to worry about making mistakes.</p>
            
   <h4>Kokuyo Campus Smartring Binder</h4>
         <p>This binder is a favorite of mine because it has the thinness and portability of a notebook.
            Another great part of it is that it comes with different types of loose leaf paper for different types of note taking.</p>
         
   <h5>Zebra Midliner Highlighter</h5>
         <p>These highlighters are amazing, the colors are immaculate and it writes so perfectly.
          You can use the highlighters for other things like coloring.</p>
